    <h2> Parameters:</h2>
    <pre>
            Cells size for adaptive threshold:
                Default value 31. This parameter describes the size of cells. If cells
                are bigger this parameter should have value closer to 41 or 51 and if cells are smaller
                value should be closer to 21. 31 is the optimal value. User should manipulate this parameter
                if algorithm can't detect some cells.

            Threshold black background mask:
                Default value 20. This parameter describes how bright are pixels in black background.
                If background is really dark the value of this parameter should be around 20.
                If background is a little brighter and applications founds some green contours in black background
                you should set parameter value to 25 or 30. User should increase these parameter if there are
                some lighter pixels on black part of background.

            Size of smallest cells:
                Default value 8. This parameter is approximation of smallest cell.
                Every cell smaller than value of this parameter will not be
                considered in counting cell's proportion. User should manipulate this parameter
                to adjust minimal cell size to cells on the image.

            Size of largest cells:
                Default value 500. This parameter is approximation of largest cell.
                Every cell bigger than value of this parameter will not be
                considered in counting cell's proportion.User should manipulate this parameter
                to adjust maximal cell size to cells on the image.

            Value to filter too bright cells:
                Default value 187. This value describes how bright can blue cells be.
                Higher value means brighter cells. Algorithm may collect some parts
                of white background and think these are blue cells, is that's the case
                User should decrease value of this parameter to get rid of
                too bright cells.

            Cells differences:
                Default value low. This value describes the differences between cells.
                If there are two visible groups of cells ( blue cells are really blue and
                black cells are really black not light-brown etc.) value of this parameter
                should be 'high', in other case if some cells are light-brown, some dark-blue
                and some blue or black the value of this parameter should be equal to 'low'
                because there are small differences between cells from both groups.
